(.,facebook marketplace) are mainly targetingindividual sellers who usually lack sufficientexperience in e-commerce. individual sellersoften struggle to compose proper descriptionsfor selling products. with the recent advance-ment of multimodal large language models(mllms), we attempt to integrate such state-of-the-art generative ai technologies into theproduct listing process. to this end, we developipl, an intelligent product listing tool tailoredto generate descriptions using various productattributes such as category, brand, color, condi-tion, etc. ipl enables users to compose prod-uct descriptions by merely uploading photosof the selling product. more importantly, itcan imitate the content style of our c2c plat-form xianyu1. this is achieved by employingdomain-specific instruction tuning on mllms,and by adopting the multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) process. a com-prehensive empirical evaluation demonstratesthat the underlying model of ipl significantlyoutperforms the base model in domain-specifictasks while producing less hallucination. iplhas been successfully deployed in our produc-tion system, where 72% of users have their pub-lished product listings based on the generatedcontent, and those product listings are shownto have a quality score % higher than thosewithout ai assistance.1 introductionwith the rise of the circular economy, second-hand e-commerce has played a vital role in ourdaily lives. unlike business-to-consumer (b2c)*these authors contributed equally to this work.†work done during an internship at alibaba group.‡corresponding author: shuguang han (email:)1xianyu is the largest c2c e-commerce platform inchina.figure 1: intelligent product listing on c2c platformse-commerce (., amazon, walmart), second-hand e-commerce is often operating in the form ofconsumer-to-consumer (c2c) transactions. dif-ferent from professional sellers on b2c platforms,individual sellers in second-hand marketplaces areusually inexperienced. they face unique chal-lenges when listing their products — navigatingthrough the complicated listing procedure, and cre-ating high-quality product descriptions. these is-sues not only affect the success rate of productlistings but also impact the overall quality and dis-coverability of the listed products.to address the above issues, it is imperative tosimplify the listing process for individual usersby leveraging automation to generate high-qualityproduct descriptions. a typical product listing pro-cess involves users manually filling in basic prod-uct attributes, uploading product photos, and com-posing content descriptions. among these steps,preparing product photos is relatively straightfor-ward. if we can automatically generate product de-scriptions based on the uploaded photos, it wouldsignificantly reduce the listing effort and enhance697user experience, as illustrated by figure 1.fortunately, product photos contain a wealth ofinformation, enabling us to infer basic attribute in-formation such as category, brand, and model fromthe imagery in most cases. moreover, recent ad-vancements in multimodal large language models(mllms) (bai et al., 2023b; achiam et al., 2023)have significantly improved both visual understand-ing and natural language generation capabilities,making it feasible to generate product descriptionsbased on product photos in an automatic manner.several large e-commerce platforms, includingebay (herold et al., 2024) and amazon (jiang et al.,2024), have begun to explore this direction by intro-ducing product listing assistants. however, thesetools are still in their infant stages. they still re-quire substantial user input, and the generated con-tent is commonly in the professional marketingstyles which lowers the information authenticityfor a c2c platform. in the context of second-hande-commerce, we encounter more challenges.lack of domain knowledge. to generate high-quality product descriptions, models must possessstrong capabilities for domain understanding (es-cursell et al., 2021; poerner et al., 2019). c2c e-commerce differs from traditional b2c platforms,its product listings often exhibit more unique andvaried characteristics. unlike professional mar-keting descriptions that emphasize persuasive lan-guage, product descriptions in c2c platforms typi-cally exhibit a more colloquial style, focusing oninformation authenticity. this helps foster trust be-tween buyers and sellers and potentially facilitatestransactions. however, existing mllms often fallshort in these areas.hallucination problem. ideally, users onlyneed to upload a photo, and the corresponding con-tent description including core product attributes isautomatically generated. however, achieving thisgoal imposes a significant challenge on the currentmllms (liang et al., 2022; ji et al., 2023). in prac-tice, mllms sometimes produce product attributesgoing beyond the image itself. this is known asthe hallucination problem in large language mod-els(llms). as the core part of the product listingexperience, we need to find a proper solution.challenges for production deployment. de-ploying generative llms on production systems,particularly for applications with a large-scale userbase, imposes high requirements on system latency,cost consumption (kwon et al., 2023), and contentsafety (perez and ribeiro, 2022). meeting thesedemands necessitates a comprehensive system en-gineering effort.to address the above issues, we develop anintelligent product listing ( ipl) system, aiming toimprove the efficiency and effectiveness for prod-uct listings on our production system.firstly, we present a notable case study of in-jecting domain knowledge into a mllm throughfurther instruction tuning of an open-source model.our domain-specific model significantly enhancesthe base model’s understanding of domain knowl-edge and enables it to generate product descriptionsin the unique style characteristic of c2c platforms.secondly, we introduce an innovative multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) ap-proach for visual-based content generation, lever-aging identical product retrieval, to enhance de-scription quality and mitigate hallucination risks inpractical applications.finally, we have successfully deployed the sys-tem in an online environment, delivering servicesto real-world individual users. this system demon-strates high user acceptance and effectively en-hances the efficiency and quality of product list-ings.our extensive empirical studies demonstrate thatipl has the potential to transform the landscapeof product listings, offering a robust, scalable solu-tion to challenges faced by individual sellers andplatforms alike.2 approachthe overall architecture of our intelligent prod-uct listing system can be illustrated in figure 2,which comprises an online multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) process for identify-ing similar products, and an offline-trained domain-specific mllm for product description generation.in our product listing system, user-uploaded pho-tos undergo category prediction, retrieval of simi-lar products, and extraction of key attributes (.,brand, model, etc.) from the descriptions of thesesimilar products. subsequently, the product photo,category, and extracted attributes are fed into thedomain-specific mllm as contextual informationto generate the product description. with this auto-matically generated description, users only need tomake minimal adjustments to complete the product 2: overview of the intelligent product listing (ipl) system architecture. domain-specific model trainingthe crucial stages in training domain-specific mod-els include the construction of training data and theprocess of model instruction tuning. domain instruction tuning datathe training data for the model encompasses prod-uct description generation, domain content under-standing, and general instruction tasks. the generalinstruction data are derived from both automati-cally generated and open-source data. an overviewof the training data is provided in table 1.data type size source modalityproduct description

visual-language, text onlyall  mixture visual-language, text onlytable 1: instruction tuning training datathe description generation dataset, which consti-tutes the primary focus of this work, involves gener-ating descriptions based on user-provided productphotos. by cleaning data from actual user-postedproduct listings, we obtained pairs of product pho-tos and descriptions. subsequently, we convertedthe data into various types of instruction formats,including generating product descriptions directlyfrom photos and generating descriptions based ona combination of product photos, key attribute tem-plates, and reference information, as illustrated intable 2. detailed data construction procedures areprovided in appendix.the content understanding tasks primarily in-clude fundamental tasks in e-commerce scenarios,especially those on c2c platforms, aimed at en-hancing the model’s domain knowledge. thesetasks include product image category prediction,product attribute extraction, and text similaritymatching, among others. this data is derived frommanually annotated data accumulated over time inbusiness scenarios. further details on the data canbe found in appendix.finally, the general instruction dataset are usedto enable the model to retain general capabilitiesand enhance its generalization ability. we employlarge language models to generate general instruc-tions and answers in the native language basedon product photos, while also incorporating high-quality open-source academic datasets as supple-mentary resources. for further details, please referto appendix. model trainingwe chose alibaba’s qwen-vl(bai et al., 2023b)model as the base model, primarily due to itsstrong performance in the native language and itsrobust open-source ecosystem. we employed full-parameter fine-tuning for model training, freezingthe visual encoder module while updating the vl-adapter and llm components only (7b parame-ters).the training objectives focused on classic nexttoken generation for language model optimization,specifically excluding loss calculation for promptprefixes and focusing on the special markers andthe model output tokens. the objective can beformally defined as:l=−t/summationdisplayt=1logp(yt|y<t, x) (1)where xdenotes the model input instructions,yrepresents the generated tokens, trefers to theposition within the generated sequence, and tisthe length of the final generated sequence. furthertraining details can be found in appendix b. online retriever-augmented generationin the online phase, the fine-tuned domain model iscapable of generating descriptions for product pho-699tos. to further mitigate hallucinations, our instruc-tions are not to directly generate descriptions fromproduct photos but to refer to product categories,core attribute templates, and retrieved information,as detailed in table 2.generation with reference informationprompt: you are an experienced seller on asecond-hand trading platform and need to postacell phone category with the product imageas shown in the picture, and the copy templateisbrand + model + storage capacity + color+ version + screen condition. in which, thebrand is

generationwith retriever-augmented generation.therefore, in online scenario, product descrip-tion generation is a retrieval-augmented gener-ation (rag) process. we conduct category pre-diction on the input product photos and simultane-ously retrieve identical products through vector re-trieval. from the retrieved products, we extract keyattribute values to serve as reference informationfor generating descriptions. the extraction of keyattribute values is accomplished using a domain-specific large model we trained, with the promptshown in table 3. key attribute sets for each cate-gory are derived from offline mining and manualsummarization, and can be retrieved through prod-uct category queries. by incorporating attributestemplate into the instructions, we can further con-trol the attributes and their sequence that the modelmust mention in the generated product descriptions,ensuring the richness of the information in the out-put descriptions.the category prediction model utilizes the al-bef network architecture(li et al., 2021; zhanget al., 2018), a classic vision-language multimodalmodel. the model has been pre-trained on domain-specific data and fine-tuned with millions of man-ually annotated datasets, achieving an accuracy ofover 80% across tens of thousands of categories.the implementation of the visual search drawsupon the work conducted by (zhang et al.,

checks on generated descriptions to preventnon-compliant content, thereby effectively avoid-ing public opinion risks. for more detailed errordetection and exception handling, please refer toappendix d.4 experiment dataour experimental data comprises both domain-specific and general datasets. all data were sourcedfrom real e-commerce scenarios and the targetlabels were either manually annotated or con-firmed by actual platform users, then convertedinto instruction format. we constructed validation700datasets encompassing tasks such as sentiment anal-ysis, information extraction, content topic selection,tagging/classification, and attribute-based visualquestion answering within the e-commerce domain(for more details, refer to appendix e). addition-ally, we included datasets specifically designed toevaluate generative style and hallucination. modeldomain-specific models: to assess the effective-ness of domain knowledge injection, we trainedseveral models with varying amounts of trainingdata. the datasets were randomly shuffled andtruncated. the comparison models include: qwen-vl (baseline, without domain training), 10% data(trained with 10% of the data), 20% data, 50%data, and 100% data.online rag system: in addressing hallucinationalleviation, we conducted experiments on variouscomponents of our online rag system. this in-cluded evaluating the use of product category in-formation, reference information from identical orsimilar products. metricsour evaluation encompasses comprehensive met-rics to assess different aspects of model perfor-mance:n-gram-based metrics : we employed bleu (pa-pineni et al., 2002), rouge and rouge-l (lin,2004) to evaluate the alignment of generated textwith ground truth product descriptions.semantic similarity metrics : bert embed-dings measured semantic similarity (sim) betweenmodel outputs and ground truth using bert-score.task-specific accuracy metrics : these metricswere used for domain-specific knowledge ques-tions, assessing model accuracy in understandingand responding to task-specific prompts.human assessment: evaluation was conductedby experts in the c2c domain, assessing whetherthe generated descriptions adhere to domain-specific style and identify key attributes(chen et al.,2024) accurately. we perform a quantitative analy-sis of the results.5 resultsin the following subsections, we discuss the fivekey research questions regarding our domain modeland the online rag system:•q1: does the domain-specific model, afterinstruction tuning, exhibit a stronger under-standing of domain knowledge?•q2: does the domain-specific model generateproduct descriptions with a more distinct c2cdomain style?•q3: can the model maintain its general capa-bilities after being trained on domain-specificdata?•q4: does the online rag mitigate hallucina-tions in product description generation?•q5: how does the ipl system perform inreal-world online scenarios?among them, q1-q3 investigate the effects of do-main knowledge injection, q4 explores the role ofonline rag, and q5 addresses online performance. rq1: enhanced domain-specificknowledgeto evaluate the model’s understanding of domain-specific knowledge, we compared its performanceon c2c e-commerce tasks involving both language-only and visual-language hybrid modalities. asshown in table 4, the domain-specific model sig-nificantly outperforms baseline across various met-rics. notably, the model shows substantial improve-ments in tasks such as e-commerce topic selectionand category recognition, while the gains in senti-ment analysis are relatively smaller. this can beattributed to the close alignment of sentiment clas-sification with general tasks, as well as its superiorbaseline performance.by truncating the training data to 10%, 20%,50%, and 100% of the original dataset, we obtaineddifferent models. the model trained with the fulldataset achieved the highest average accuracy, fol-lowed by the model trained with 50% of the data.in the topic selection and category recognitiontasks, the accuracy increased significantly withthe amount of training data. for the content tag-ging and vision-based product attribute extrac-tion tasks, accuracy improved significantly afteradding 20% of the data, but showed minor fluctua-tions with further increases in training data beyond20%. rq2: enhanced domain-specific stylegeneration abilitywe also evaluated whether the model’s generatedlistings exhibit domain-specific stylistic elements.given that style preferences are subjective, humanevaluation is the most reliable method. an experi-enced

text-based product attribute extraction (tae).paring the linguistic style of listings generated bydifferent models for the same product and castingvotes. the results, presented in table 5, indicatea significant preference for our model’s outputs.in contrast, qwen-vl’s listings were often per-ceived as unnatural, verbose, and overly marketing-oriented, which is undesirable in c2c personalseller scenarios. we also experimented with var-ious prompts for qwen-vl to mitigate prompt-induced biases. rq3: retains general capabilitieswe assessed the model’s retention of general ca-pabilities using well-established benchmarks suchas mmbench (liu et al., 2023) , mme(fu et al.,2023), and seedbench(li et al., 2024), drawing ref-erence from the work of llav a  and qwen-vl.our model outperforms llav a  and qwen-vlon the mmbench task, and achieves performanceclosely comparable to llav a  on the mmetask. however, it demonstrates relatively weakerperformance on the seedbench task.on one hand, seedbench focuses on detailed im-age analysis tasks, including scene understanding,instance identity, instance location, instance count-ing. in contrast, mmbench emphasizes overallimage analysis, encompassing tasks such as imagetopic and attribute recognition. our training sam-ples are based on commonly used general-domaindata and additionally incorporate e-commerce prod-uct understanding, encompassing tasks such ascategory recognition and product attribute extrac-tion. from the perspective of the high-quality train-ing samples, this demonstrates a greater improve-ment for mmbench compared to the seedbench the other hand, the difficulty of the tasksreveals that seedbench is indeed more challenging,as detailed image analysis requires the model topossess strong pixel resolution, multi-object recog-nition capabilities, and spatial recognition  model still has space for improvement onthese tasks. the generalization obtained from ex-isting universal samples aids in enhancing bothinstruction-following abilities and image recogni-tion capabilities. therefore, we will continue torefine these abilities in our future work.model win:loss win rateours vs qwen-vl 948:101 %table

evaluation: based on productphotos, user-generated descriptions, and model-generated descriptions, evaluators are required toassess the accuracy of the attributes (., brand,model) in the model outputs. subsequently, we cancompute the accuracy rate.machine automatic evaluation: the content gen-erated by the model was compared to the user-written descriptions using metrics such as sim,bleu and rouge.the specific results are shown in table 7.as opposed to only giving the image to themllms, our model significantly improved all met- in the human manual evaluation ofattribute accuracy,

effectively mitigates hal-lucination. this indicates that the information ob-tained solely from product images is limited and ne-cessitates supplementary references. on the otherhand, the direct contribution of product categoriesis relatively minor. the primary function of cate-gory prediction is to obtain the relevant attributestemplate, thereby enhancing the controllability ofthe generation process in rag. rq5: online a/b test resultsto evaluate the performance of the ipl system, weconducted online a/b testing. the objective was tomeasure the adoption rate of product descriptionsgenerated by ipl and to compare the advantagesover not using ipl. our experiments demonstratea high user acceptance rate for our system: up to72% of users are willing to continue modifying theautomatically generated descriptions to completeproduct listings, and over 32% of users adopt morethan 50% of the generated content. furthermore,products utilizing the auto-description generationfeature exhibit a % improvement in overall qual-ity scores compared to similar products that do notuse this feature. the product quality score, an inter-nal metric used by the platform to assess productquality, is primarily calculated based on the rich-ness of descriptions and the aesthetic authenticityof photos. the details of the quality score definitioncan be found in appendix.6 related workmultimodal llm: recent advances in large lan-guage models such as gpt-4, llama(touvronet al., 2023), and qwen(bai et al., 2023a), havedemonstrated impressive capabilities in understand-ing world knowledge and generating diverse text.these models have shown significant potential inzero-shot or few-shot(wang et al., 2020) learningscenarios, exhibiting strong instruction-followingabilities(ouyang et al., 2022). recent works, in-cluding blip-2(li et al., 2023), minigpt-4(zhuet al., 2023), and qwen-vl(bai et al., 2023b), haveexplored integrating visual and textual modalitiesfrom various perspectives. however, these modelslack training on domain-specific (c2c) private data,resulting in insufficient domain understanding andinconsistent domain-specific style outputs, whichlimits their effectiveness in related tasks.retrieval-augmented generation: hallucina-tion remains a major challenge in the develop-ment of llms(guerreiro et al., 2023)(ji et al.,2023). approaches such as visualgpt(wu et al.,2023), hugginggpt(shen et al., 2024), and tool-former(schick et al., 2024) leverage existing ma-ture modules to perform complex operations. an-other method, involves text retrieval-based aug-mentation(guu et al., 2020; izacard et al., 2023;robertson et al., 2009; karpukhin et al., 2020),where external resources(guu et al., 2020) or web-retrieved(nakano et al., 2021) texts are fed intothe prompts to provide llms with more accu-rate (mallen et al., 2022; kandpal et al., 2023)ref-erence information to mitigate hallucinations(liet al., 2022; kang and choi, 2023). unlike thesemethods, our research uniquely integrates visual-based retrieval augmentation with mllms and suc-cessfully applies it in the e-commerce domain, ad-dressing the hallucination problem while enhancingtask-specific performance.7 conclusionwe presented ipl system, a novel framework thatgenerates high-quality, accurate product descrip-tions based on images, enhancing item listing effi-ciency in the c2c market. by leveraging mllmstrained via domain injection, our model gainsdeeper domain-specific knowledge and style com-pared to the original model (qwen-vl). the im-plementation of online rag, which uses similarproduct images as reference, reduces hallucinationin mllms, resulting in more precise descriptions.the effectiveness of our framework is demonstratedthrough human evaluations, machine assessments,and online a/b  limitationsour ipl system generates precise descriptions tai-lored to individual seller styles, streamlining theposting process and enhancing the quality of list-ings. our system exhibits notable potential forfurther optimization. firstly, the core attributestemplate is predominantly based on extensive de-scriptive statistics and do not yet account for per-sonalized user posting styles. secondly, the accu-racy of generated descriptions for certain long-tailcategories requires improvement. to advance oursystem, we intend to incorporate additional train-ing samples from long-tail categories and integrateuser personalization data. this approach aims to en-hance the accuracy and personalization of productdescriptions, thereby increasing adoption rates andaiding users in efficiently producing high-quality, steven adler, sandhini agarwal, lamaahmad, ilge akkaya, florencia leoni aleman,diogo

tool allowing marketers to quickly and cost-effectively develop advertisements. however, concerns about deception and misinformation voiced by consumers, ad agencies, and governments have led to mandates to disclose ai-generated content. given the importance of visual advertising for service tangibilization, whether services marketers should use genai to advertise services, and how, is a pressing question that this paper investigates. we apply a source credibility framework to explore factors in genai service ad design that influence trust toward the service provider and ad attitudes. three experiments uncover that ai disclosures result in lower trust and less positive ad attitudes. ads designed to focus on intangible attributes (., a dentist ’s image) are less effective relative to ads focusing on tangible attributes (., a dentist ’s equipment) when an ai disclosure is present. however, trust and ad attitudes can be restored when ai is selectively used to generate an ad’s tangible attributes, but not the intangible (., a real dentist at an ai-generated office). our findings thus provide concrete guidance on how services marketers can use ai to enjoy the cost and speed benefits of ai ad development while preserving trust and ad attitudes.generative ai (genai) is an emerging tool for developing ads, with major companies such as google and meta offering prompt-based ad generation to optimize performance. genai can be used in ad develop -ment to generate copy, video, and visual elements more efficiently and less expensively (deck, 2023 ). for instance, ogilvy and cadbury part-nered with indian superstar shah rukh khan to produce “my ad,” an ai-powered ad campaign for indian businesses, with khan “mentioning ” these businesses by name in over one hundred thousand unique social media ads (naidu and coulter, 2023 ).as genai has increased in popularity among consumers and busi-nesses, so have concerns about the trustworthiness of ai-generated content (li et al., 2024 ). 75% of consumers favor ai-generated ad dis-closures (dentsu, 2023 ). such transparency has gained support from companies such as google (agius, 2023 ) and ogilvy (thomas and murphy, 2023 ), as well as. legislators (baek et al., 2024 ).understanding the influence of ai disclosure is particularly critical in the context of ai-generated services advertising. due to the intangibility of services, advertisers employ tangibilization. tangibilization refers to intentionally designing ads to visually depict highly intangible service elements that are difficult for consumers to grasp, with the objective of providing more clarity regarding the service experience (gilbert and stafford, 2022 ). to achieve tangibilization, services advertising tends to include more visuals than copy (bambauer-sachse and heinzle, 2018 ) and features more people than product ads (clow et al., 2006 ). given service advertisers ’ reliance on imagery in ads and their positive impact on consumer responses via trust, using genai to develop service ads might result in a more efficient and less costly ad design process, but at the potential expense of reduced trust and less positive ad attitudes when disclosing the use of ai technology in ads. thus, it would be valuable for marketers to understand how genai disclosures influence attitude toward service advertisements in combination with other advertising design choices.this research aims to fill in this gap. from the lens of source credi -bility theory, we examine how disclosing ai-generated advertising that incorporates visual elements depicting synthetic people (particularly service providers), or settings in which the service is delivered, in-fluences consumer attitude toward the advertisement. our findings suggest that while ai disclosures may lead to less positive attitudes to-ward service ads, strategically using ai to generate only the tangible features of a service in advertising can mitigate the negative effect.*corresponding author.e-mail addresses:  (. grigsby),  (m. michelsen),  (c. zamudio). contents lists available at sciencedirectjournal of retailing and consumer servicesu{�~zkw! s{yo|kro>!

framework. effect of ai disclosure labels on attitude toward advertisementresearch exploring consumers’ reactions to ai disclosure reports mixed findings. ai disclosures have been found to decrease consumer preference in creative tasks (., fashion design, lee and kim, 2024 ) compared to when humans performed these tasks, while ai disclosures positively influence perceptions of objectivity in ads (wu and wen, 2021 ) and sales offers (garvey et al., 2023 ). bakpayev et al. (2020)found that ai-generated ads using emotional appeals were evaluated lower than those created by designers, but evaluations were not different when ads used rational appeals. these mixed findings suggest that the influence of ai disclosures may depend on the task and the context (baek et al., 2024 ; wu et al., 2024 ).a key characteristic of services is their intangibility, which refers to the aspects of a service offering that are impalpable, subjective, impossible to touch or try on (shostack, 1977 ), and thus difficult to fully understand (wirtz et al., 2021 ). service ads use tangibilization to make it easier for the consumer to understand the service experience (bambauer-sachse and heinzle, 2018 ) and to enhance marketing out-comes such as more positive attitudes toward the brand (leong et al., 2018 ), perceived service quality and purchase intentions (clow et al., 2006 ; hill et al., 2004 ).the message source, or the entity the audience believes is the sender of the advertising message, is an important part of successful tangibili -zation. source credibility theory argues that two components influence the effectiveness of a message source: 1) trustworthiness, related to perceptions of the source’s relevant expertise and honesty (baek et al., 2024 ), and 2) attractiveness, related to the perceptions that the source is likeable and similar to the audience (stafford et al., 2002 ). research has found that when a message source is trustworthy and likable to the audience, the source positively influences consumers’ belief in the ad claims and valence of attitudes toward the ad (shareef et al., 2019 ). further, a source that provides concrete cues about the service experi -ence helps consumers understand the service process and benefits (bakri et al., 2020 ).when consumers view a genai advertisement with no ai disclosure, the brand serves as the message source. without additional information from other sources, the ad’s persuasiveness would be similar to a typical designer-created ad. when an ai disclosure is present on an ad, it in-dicates ai’s involvement in its creation. this introduces ai as a message source because the disclosure reveals how the ad was made and where the information in the ad originated. ai performance is often judged as unproven and unclear, eliciting higher uncertainty from consumers (lee and kim, 2024 ), as they worry about the “accuracy, authenticity, bias, or manipulation” of ai (erskine et al., 2023 , p. 1). uncertainty is negatively related to source credibility (byun et al., 2021 ). in the ai service ad context, a less positive attitude occurs because uncertainty from the ad source reduces service tangibilization, increasing the difficulty to verify and evaluate service experience (guo and wang, 2024 ). h1. service ads with ai disclosure labels will generate less positive attitudes compared to the same service ads with no disclosure labels.. mediating role of trusttrust in the context of services has extensively focused on the con-sumer’s belief in the service provider’s reliability, competence, and quality to deliver what is promised (chiou and droge, 2006 ; huang et al., 2024 ). service providers, thus, are an important source of trust. when consumers view a service ad, source credibility theory suggests that consumers will rely on the source of the ad to determine trust because the ad helps consumers judge the service provider’s intentions and ability to deliver (baek et al., 2024 ). if an ad is ai-generated, due to the skepticism associated with ai technology (erskine et al., 2023 ), consumers may be less likely to trust factual information developed by ai (glikson and woolley, 2020 ), leading to less positive attitudes and less desirable behavioral responses (arango et al., 2023 ; hussain et al., 2020 ). thus, we propose that when an advertisement is disclosed as ai-generated, it shifts the primary source of the ad message from a real service brand (high trust) to ai (low trust). lower trust is associated with less positive attitudes toward the ad (hussain et al., 2020 ). stated formally. h2. the influence of ai disclosure on ad attitudes will be mediated by trust.. moderating effect of service ad focus on trustmost services feature a bundle of intangible and tangible attributes (., inpatient care has hospital facilities and interactions between pa-tients and health professionals). intangible attributes, typically the ser-vice providers themselves, contact consumers actively, customize the service (mersha, 1990 ), and build relationships with consumers (güntürkün et al., 2020 ). conversely, tangible attributes, typically the service environment and equipment, contact consumers passively and do not result in customization (mersha, 1990 ) or relational bonds. based on this distinction between service attribute types, we conceptualize service ads can be either intangibility-focused (., a dentistry ad emphasizing the dentist’s image, whose skills and friendliness are intangible attributes) or tangibility-focused (., a dentistry ad featuring only tangible attributes such as a dentist’s office with typical dental care equipment).to highlight specific attributes in service ads with different foci, vi-sual cues are often employed because visually emphasized information becomes more salience in consumers’ memory (pooresmaeili et al., 2014 ), influencing their evaluation of the ad and the advertised brand (bordalo et al., 2022 ). intangibility-focused service ads usually highlight the service provider that is positioned as the source of the message, making the service provider more salient and the central focus for consumer evaluation. conversely, tangibility-focused service ads emphasize the service environment as the focal point for evaluation.differences are expected when consumers evaluate these service ads. when intangible attributes (., a service provider) are shown in an ad, tangibilization occurs through association (berry and clark, 1986 ; utkarsh and medhavi, 2016 ), which links the person featured in the ad to the service. consumers will evaluate the service provider’s reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy (., the intangible servqual dimensions, parasuraman et al., 1985 ) to determine trust and judge service quality. however, when tangible attributes are shown in a ser-vice ad, tangibilization occurs through physical representation (berry and clark, 1986 ; gilbert and stafford, 2022 ), which illustrates the ser-vice environment, including physical facilities and equipment (., the tangible servqual dimension). thus, when the ai-disclosure label is absent, an intangibility-focused ad should be just as effective at building trust as a tangibility-focused ad. however, when the ai-disclosure label is present, given the relational bond that consumers expect to have with the service provider and the importance of trust for building relation -ships (balakrishnan and dwivedi, 2021 ), we expect that an intangibility-focused ad will result in significantly less trust compared to a tangibility-focused ad. stated formally. h3. ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus will interact to influence trust in the service brand. when the disclosure label is present, an intangibility-focused ad is expected to generate lower trust compared to a tangibility-focused ad. when the disclosure label is absent, no dif-ferences in trust are expected.h4. the interaction between ai disclosure label and service ad focus will influence consumer attitude toward the service ad through trust in the service. grigsby et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               journal of retailing and consumer services 84 (2025) 104231. moderating effect of intangible attribute creation source on trustwe propose that one way to mitigate the less positive attitudes to-ward ai-generated service ads is to use genai exclusively to generate imagery associated with the tangible attributes in the ad and to disclose the selective application of ai in the disclosure label (., a label stating: “the background in this ad was developed using ai. the photo of the dentist was not developed using ai”).for such attenuation to occur, full transparency in disclosure labels by indicating which elements in the ads are real and which are ai- generated is needed. transparency in communicating brand ’s business practices indicates brand openness and accountability, helping trust- building (lin et al., 2017 ; wang and qiu, 2024 ). however, although ai disclosure signals transparency, skepticism about the technology ’s reliability may still be a barrier for consumers to fully trust ai-generated information (glikson and woolley, 2020 ), as we hypothesized earlier. contrast this to when consumers observe an ai disclosure on a service ad for which the intangible attribute is not generated by ai: since intangible attributes are key service differentiators (ding and keh, 2017 ), if they are not ai-generated and this information is disclosed in service ads, such transparency preserves source credibility. hence, we expect that disclosing ai’s non-involvement in creating intangible attributes in service ads will have no negative impact on trust.to illustrate how intangibility of service attributes and ai disclosure label transparency impact trust, consider a dentistry ad depicting an ai- generated office with dental care equipment (., tangible attributes) as background and a dentist (., intangible attribute) as foreground, either created using ai or using a real person ’s photo. when the ai disclosure label is absent, there will be no trust differences regardless of how the ad was created. ai label presence will influence trust depending on the contents of the label itself. specifically, when the entire ad was developed using ai and the label confirms this, we expect that our findings will replicate our prior studies: trust should be lower when compared to the conditions in which the ai label is absent. however, when only the tangible attributes in the background of the ad were ai- generated and the depicted service provider was not (which is explained by the disclosure label), we expect that trust will be just as high as when the disclosure label is absent. finally, different degrees of trust will lead to different valences of attitudes toward the ad. stated formally.  disclosure label and intangible attribute creation source will interact to influence trust in the service brand. when the disclosure label is present, consumers are expected to have lower trust in an ad with ai- generated intangible attributes compared to an ad featuring intangible attributes with real images. when the disclosure label is absent, no differences in trust are expected. interaction between ai disclosure label and intangible attri-bute creation source will influence consumer attitude toward the service ad through trust in the service brand. of studiesacross three studies, we demonstrate that ai disclosure label pres-ence (vs. absence) leads to less positive ad attitudes through reduced trust in the advertised service brand. we also examine two moderators that influence trust (see fig. 1). all the scales used in the three studies are from prior research (see table 1for scale items). all the ads were created using the image generative ai tool dreamstudio.across the three studies, to account for the possibility of common method bias, we relied on two approaches. first, the harman single- factor method was used (., sengoz et al., 2024 ). in neither study did the largest explanatory power of the first factor exceed 40%. second, we computed the vifs of each explanatory variable in each study, and none of the vifs exceeded 5 (., wong and wong, 2024 ). as such, there is no evidence to indicate common method bias in the three studies. finally, the sample sizes across studies were reviewed using the g*power application, and we concluded that no study was underpowered. 1. pretest 1we pretested three restaurant ads and three restaurant names. a total of 150 participants (% male, % female, % nonbinary; mage 40) were recruited through the cloudresearch connect platform and fig.  of. grigsby et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               journal of retailing and consumer services 84 (2025) 1042314randomly assigned to view one ad and one restaurant name. we measured participants ’ attitudes to the ad, ad attractiveness, image appropriateness for a restaurant ad, and the extent to which participants believed the ad was developed by ai.no significant differences emerged among the three ads on the ad- related measures, but ad 3 (m ) was rated marginally as less likely to be ai-generated than ad 1 (m , p .11) and ad 2 (m , p .06). thus, ad 3 was selected. two restaurant names (varela and fremont place) were rated as equally appropriate. varela was selected because previous research found it to be an unfamiliar brand (grigsby et al., 2023 ). fig. 2shows the final. study 1 design and resultsparticipants and procedure. study 1 employed a single-factor design (ai disclosure label: absent vs. present). a total of 210 participants (% male, % female, % nonbinary; mage 39) were recruited through the cloudresearch connect platform and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. participants who missed an attention check (“the researchers would like you to select strongly disagree for this question ”) were excluded from analysis, resulting in a final sample of 201 participants. after viewing the assigned advertisement, participants reported their attitude towards the ad and perceived trust towards the advertised restaurant. ai detection was captured for use as a manipu -lation check. demographics (age, gender, english as a first language), restaurant consumption frequency, and ad attractiveness were captured for use as covariates since these variables could influence participants ’ interest in and evaluation of the advertised restaurant (raoofpanah et al., 2023 ).results. an independent samples t-test found that the ai disclosure label manipulation was successful; participants in the disclosure absent condition (m ) rated that ad as less likely to be ai-generated compared to those in the disclosure present condition (m , t () , p ).covariates for the one-way ancova were restaurant consumption frequency (r .82), perceived ad attractiveness (r .82), age, gender, and english as a first language (estimated marginal means are reported). as expected, attitudes (cronbach ’s α .96) toward the ad were more positive when the label was absent (m ) compared to when the label was present (m , f(1, 193) , p ), supporting h1. mediation through trust (process model 4, hayes, 2018 ) was sup-ported at the 90% confidence level (indirect effect:.13, 90% ci:.29 to .0045), providing marginal support for h2.discussion. study 1 suggested that ai disclosure resulted in less pos-itive attitudes toward the ad (h1) and provided marginal support for trust as the mediating process (h2). study 2 explores these effects using different service ads with either an intangibility-focus or a tangibility- focus. 2. pretest 2a dental service was selected because the dentist (., intangible attribute) is more important than their clinic room (., the tangible attribute). pretest 2 was conducted to select two dentistry advertise -ments, focusing on the dentist and his office, respectively, as well as to test the appropriateness of the dentistry name.six dentistry advertisements were created, ads 1–3 focusing on a dentist (three different dentist images) and ads 4–6 only showing a dental clinic room (three different room images). a total of 303 partic -ipants (% male, % female, 1% nonbinary; mage 39) were recruited through cloudresearch connect. they were randomly assigned to view one of the six advertisements, and then reported their attitudes toward the ad, ad attractiveness, image appropriateness, and ai detection. next, participants were shown the name “varela dentistry ” and rated its appropriateness. it was desirable to choose a set of ads (one with and one without a service provider) that were equal on the mea-surements included in the pretest. we chose the only set in which both ads met this requirement (all p-values ) for use in study 2 (see fig. 3for final stimuli).. study 2 design and resultsparticipants and procedure. study 2 employed a 2 (ai disclosure label: absent vs. present) x 2 (service ad focus: tangible vs. intangible attri-bute) between-subjects design. a total of 402 participants (% male, 46% female, % nonbinary;

view one of the four ads and responded to the measures of interest (the same as in study 1). participants who missed the attention check were excluded from analysis (n 24) for a final sample of 378 participants.results. the manipulation of ai disclosure was successful; an inde-pendent samples t-test found that participants in the disclosure absent condition (m ) perceived the ad as less likely to be ai-generated than those in the disclosure present condition (m , t() , p ).covariates for the two-way ancova were dentist visit frequency (r .75), perceived attractiveness of the ad (r .73), age, gender, and english as a first language (estimated marginal means are reported). these covariates were selected as they could influence participants ’ interest in and evaluation of the advertised dentist (white et al., 2020 ). the interaction between ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus on trust (cronbach ’s α .96) was significant (f(1, 368) , p ), in support of h3. specifically, with an ai disclosure, trust was significantly lower in the intangibility-focused ad featuring the dentist (mdentist ) than in the tangibility-focused ad featuring the clinic room (mroom , f(1, 184) , p ). without a disclosure, no differences emerged (mdentist , mroom , p ). mediation (h4), such that the interaction between ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus influence ad attitudes (cronbach ’s α .98) through trust toward the service provider, was also supported (process model 7, index of moderated mediation .29, 95% ci:.55 to .06; see fig. 4). when the service ad focus was tangible, the con-ditional indirect effect was not significant (effect .05, 95% ci:.23 to.11). when the service ad focus was intangible, the conditional indirect was significant, as expected (effect .34, 95% ci:.56 to .16).discussion. study 2 found that the focus of the service ad moderated the effect of ai disclosure on trust in the advertised service brand. as predicted, ai disclosure labels reduced trust in intangible-focused ads more than tangible-focused ads. our results also show support for trust as the mediating process. both studies 1 and 2 reveal the negative effects of ai disclosure. how to attenuate this effect is investigated in study 3. 3. pretest 3pretest 3 was conducted to find a label for an ad design with an intangible attribute creation source that was real (., a photo) against an ai-generated background. we designed two dentistry ads with identical ai-generated backgrounds (., a dental clinic room) but two different dentist sources: one ai-generated (ad 1) and one real dentist in a photo (ad 2). since ad 1 was entirely ai-generated, it had our previ -ously tested label, “this ad was developed using ai.” for ad 2, we designed three different label variation conditions: 1) “the background in this ad was developed using ai.”; 2) “the background in this ad was developed using ai. the dentist in the photo is dr. varela. ”; and 3) “the background in this ad was developed using ai. the photo of the dentist dr. varela was not generated using ai.”a total of 200 participants (56% male, 43% female,.5% nonbinary; mage 37) were recruited through cloudresearch and randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. after viewing the ad, participants answered the ai detection questions with two items, capturing their perceptions of the background and dentist, respectively. this modifi -cation was to ensure participants were correctly interpreting the label and understanding which parts of the ad were ai-generated.participants ’ perceptions that the background was ai-generated did not differ across the four ads (all p-values , all means ), indicating that participants had relatively high perceptions that the background in all the conditions was ai-generated. for ad 1, partici -pants ’ perceptions that the dentist was ai-generated were the highest (m ), compared to ad 2 label 1 (m , post hoc p ), ad 2 label 2 (m , post hoc p ), and ad 2 label 3 (m , post hoc p ). since the mean for label 3 was the lowest, it indicated that label 3 most clearly communicated that in ad 2, the dentist was not ai-generated, and we selected label 3 for ad 2 (see fig. 5for the final stimuli).. study 3 design and resultsparticipants and procedure. study 3 employed a 2 (ai disclosure label: absent vs. present) x 2 (intangible attribute creation source: ai- generated vs. photo) between-subjects design. a total of 399 partici -pants (% male, % female, % nonbinary; mage 38) were recruited through cloudresearch connect and randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. participants who missed the attention check were excluded from analysis, resulting in a final sample of 373. the procedure of study 3 was identical to study 2 except the manipulation check questions that measured the perception of ai involvement in ad creation included two items (as in pretest 3).results. independent samples t-tests found that the manipulation was successful. all the background images were perceived as ai-generated, with this perception being stronger in the disclosure present condition (m ) than in the disclosure absent condition (m , t() , p ). when comparing participants ’ perceptions of the dentist image in the ai-generated conditions (m ) and the photo conditions (m , t(371) , p ), we found the photo image was perceived more as a real person.covariates for the two-way ancova were dentist frequency (r .82), age, gender, and english as a first language (estimated marginal means are reported), selected as they may influence participants ’ eval-uation of the advertised dentist (white et al., 2020 ). the interaction on trust (cronbach ’s α .96) was significant (f(1, 363) , p ), supporting h5. with the label present, trust toward the dentist was significantly greater when the image was a photo (m ) than when it was ai-generated (m , f(1, 178) , p ). with the label absent, there were no differences in trust toward the dentist fig.  mediation effect on attitude toward ad (study 2).. grigsby et al.

disclosure labels generally reduce trust and result in less positive ad attitudes, these effects can be attenuated by ad design. fig.  for study 3.fig.  mediation effect on attitude toward ad (study

challenge in marketing and advertising re-search is understanding when and why digital assets such aspromotional content perform well during a marketing push.by leveraging raw image feature vectors extracted from largedatasets, we can train performance prediction models usingonline social signals such as likes or views. while the resultingmodels make accurate predictions, they are opaque and rely onabstract features within the model, making attribution almostimpossible. this paper demonstrates an approach to performanceprediction modelling for image based digital creative assets.utilising a combination of pre-trained vision model embeddingswith a pipeline of generative artificial intelligence (ai) for imagesynthesis and manipulation, we establish a means of determiningthe performance of explainable components. this enables flexibleperformance prediction, even with smaller datasets, with highdegree of explainability through the attribution of image featurescorrelating with high or low performance.index terms —deep feature extractors, performance analysesattribution pipeline, transformers, diffusion models, digitalcreativesi. i ntroductionin marketing and advertising research, creating content thatwill resonate with consumers is critical, but predicting thepotential performance of marketing assets is a complex prob-lem. this requires a careful understanding of the individualfactors contributing to consumer response, not just predictingwhat will perform well, but why. the ideal system would beable to:1) understand what characteristics are in an image (hence-forth referred to as an asset),2) accurately predict its performance (as measured in likes,clicks, views, etc.),3) be interpretable, allowing the user to attribute perfor-mance to specific characteristics in the asset.approaches based on neural networks like a convolutionalneural net (cnn) [1] or an multi-layer perceptron (mlp)[2] have been shown to give state-of-the-art accuracy in per-formance modelling. these networks can in turn leverage theembeddings of other vision models that are trained on millionsof images to create a nuanced prediction of performance.whilst this increases prediction accuracy, the models behaveas black boxes with no feature attribution capability.if we want to prioritise attribution, we can switch toinputs that are human-readable, such as one-hot encoded tagsextracted either manually or by using other ai systems likeobject detection models. this approach increases explainabil-ity as it can provide importance scores for all the input tagsfrom which we can determine the effect of elements in theimage on the performance prediction. however, methods basedon extraction of tags are restrictive and do not cover subtleelements that might contribute to the prediction and thusinherently less accurate.currently, one can either emphasise on prediction accuracy,or explainability of results. to bridge this gap, we proposea pipeline of various ai systems to leverage neural networksand generative models to achieve state-of-the-art performanceprediction while also creating a flexible and accurate systemfor attribution.the main contribution of this work is a system of ai sys-tems that allows for performance attribution from input vectorsthat were produced in abstract space without compromisingon predictive accuracy. the first part of this system uses apre-trained cnn model backbone to extract feature vectorsfrom images being used in advertisements. the feature vectorsare then passed as inputs to a xgboost model to predictthe target performance variable (likes, clicks etc.). we thenutilise a pipeline (henceforth referred to as anvil) whichcontains generative models that modify the image accordingto specific patterns, creating variations on the original imageby either removing or adding components. these new imagesare generated in line with whichever component we arespecifically testing for attribution. the altered assets are thenfed to the prediction pipeline mentioned earlier to get a newprediction. by carefully and consistently generating variationsof the initial asset, we are able to understand which modifiedcomponents are affecting performance and by how much.this paper is structured as follows. section ii outlinesrelated work. section iii details the proposed pipeline, in-cluding feature extraction, predictive model, and performanceattribution. we then provide an analysis of the results insection iv. the paper ends with conclusions and a discussionon future work in section v.ii. r

advanced im-plementation. it works by sequentially adding simple modelsto correct the errors made by previous models and is optimizedto have high computational efficiency. the model is based ontree algorithm and hence has the ability to assign importancescores to the input variable which can be used in attribution.however, for the importance scores to be usable, input featuresneed to be human-interpretable variables.an ensemble learning technique called random forest [4]combines the predictions from several decision trees to gen-erate a single, more reliable forecast. this kind of supervisedlearning technique is applicable to tasks involving both re-gression and classification. the algorithm uses techniques likebootstrap and aggregation, commonly known as bagging thatenables it to use multiple decision trees. each decision treehas a significant variance, but when we aggregate them all atonce, the variance that results is reduced because each treeis perfectly trained on a specific sample of the data. similarto xgboost random forest also provides importance scoresfor input variables but with the same drawback of these inputvariables have to human interpretability to be useful.gradient-weighted class activation mapping (grad-cam)[5], is a gradient mapping technique that uses the gradientsof any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network orlikes on an instagram in regression network) flowing into thefinal convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization maphighlighting the important regions in the image for predictingthe concept.methods to make tree-based models interpretable have beenproposed by [6] and [7]. whilst these methods would givean indication of the features that contribute the most toperformance, these features need to be human-readable forthe methods to work. in the case of images, the inputs to thetree models above are feature vectors and hence not easilyinterpretable. additionally, ensemble tree-based models relyon multiple ”weak learners” for their predictive accuracy andas such can identify combinations of features that lead to near-perfect predictions. attribution, by definition, requires a smallnumber of individual predictors and as such becomes a moredifficult problem to tackle [8].the algorithms mentioned above either require inputs (likeobject tags) that are extremely reductive or have a verysimplistic mechanism for performance attribution as in thecase with grad-cam. we propose a pipeline of ai systems thatovercome both of these drawbacks to give detailed attributionwith a much richer input.iii. m ethodologyto demonstrate and test the methodology described herein,we have used images posted on the social media accountof a car manufacturer and used the number of likes as thetarget performance variable. as expected, the vast majorityof the images depicted cars in various settings. the datasetconsisted of approximately 13,700 images that were sharedbetween october 2012 and march 2024. the average numberof likes was non-stationary (., changed over time), showinga steady increase up to 2017 after which it stabilized (see fig3). this was likely driven by the growth of the social mediaplatform and of this specific account and not related to theimages themselves. to avoid any issues with non-stationarity,any images pre-2017 ( images) were not used in trainingand testing the prediction model. they were only used as partof testing the attribution methodology.the proposed prediction and attribution pipeline can besubdivided into the following three stages ():a. feature extractionas a first step, we need to extract information from theimages. the preferred method of doing so is by removing theprediction layer from pre-trained vision models and using thedense vector from the truncated model as highly condensedimage features. there are several vision models with very highgeneralizing capabilities trained on big datasets like imagenet[9] that we could have chosen from. primarily, we consideredthe choice between multimodal models like clip [10] andmonomodal models like resnet models. we went with the cliparchitecture as our feature extractor for the following reasons:1) comparisons between resnet200d and clip-vit-base-patch32 showed minimal differences in validation error(see table i);2) clip’s ability to project image features and text featuresin the same space can be useful in interrogating themodel in later experiments;3) the length of the feature vector produced by resnet is4 times larger than the one produced by clip (2048 vs512) and hence clip can be trained on smaller datasetswithout the risk of overfitting.the clip base model uses a vit-l/14 [11] transformerarchitecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention transformer as a text encoder. these encoders aretrained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs viaa contrastive loss function. after extracting features fromthe clip model we use these feature vectors as input to asubsequent model used to predict the performance metricssuch as likes, impressions etc.in addition to the image features, relevant metadata canbe added to the image. whilst our dataset did not containsuch metadata, metadata such as country, media channel,and audience selection are often available in marketing andadvertising datasets. our methodology allows these featuresto be appended to the image features extracted from clip.b. asset performance predictionthe feature vectors are used as inputs to xgboost. asmentioned above, we set the target performance variable asthe number of likes that each image received. in order toobtain the best possible results from xgboost, we normalisedand detrended the target variable. the absolute number oflikes was normalised based on a twelve-month rolling average,removing the effects of seasonality as much as possible. asdiscussed above, the non-stationary part of the data was alsoremoved. we also cube-root transformed the target variable,which gives it a more normal-like distribution. this has theeffect of reducing skewness and decreasing the impact ofoutliers on the model. by making this choice, we accept higher2024 19th annual system of systems engineering conference (sose)135authorized licensed use limited to: indiana university. downloaded on march 03,2025 at 04:48:22 utc from ieee

best performance to complexity ratio among the3 models tested.c. asset performance attribution (anvil)for the attribution stage we use two models for our anvilpipeline to modify elements in the image asset. stable dif-fusion [12] models are a class of generative ai models thatgenerate high-resolution images of varying quality. they workby gradually adding gaussian noise to the original data inthe forward diffusion process and then learning to remove thenoise in the reverse diffusion process. they are latent variablemodels referring to a hidden continuous feature space. theylook similar to variational autoencoders (v aes) [13], and areloosely based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics.controlnet [14] functions as a complete neural networkstructure taking charge of substantial image diffusion models,like stable diffusion, to grasp task-specific input conditions.controlnet achieves this by replicating the weights of a majordiffusion model into both a “trainable copy” and a “lockedcopy.” the locked copy preserves the learned network trainedfrom vast image data, while the trainable copy gets trainedon task-specific datasets to master conditional control. thisprocess connects trainable and locked neural network segmentsusing an exceptional convolution layer called “zero convolu-tion.” in this layer, convolution weights progressively evolvefrom zeros to optimal settings through a learned approach.our generative pipeline segments the image asset andisolates different elements of the image, such as the principleobject(s): the car, models wearing apparels of a brand etc aswell as other supporting elements such as trees, hill, beach etc.after choosing the element, the user can modify it using thefollowing steps: (1) the image is first segmented by a trans-former model for image segmentation [15]. (2) then the userselects the element of the image to be modified. (3) the userpasses the prompt to the controlnet and stable diffusion modelwhich generate a new image with a modified version of theselected element based on the prompt. examples of modifiedimages can be seen in figure 6. anvil allows rapid and batchmanipulation of images using generative ai to quickly createan attribution dataset. by utilizing fully generated imagery aswell as synthetic variations of existing images controlling fora desired attribute, control environments can be generated fortesting most conceivable components. for this paper we havefocused on the social media output of car manufacturers and assuch our performance attribution techniques are more focusedon image manipulation of vehicles and scenes, however thistechnique could be potentially applied to any subject  19th

the predicted performance. a large numberof images can be modified at scale to establish confidence ofattribution. alternatively, since the feature extraction modelused is multi-modal, we can pass sentences containing adescription of an image to the xgboost model. this is a fasterand more consistent method of interrogating the model.iv. r esults and discussiona. hypothesis a: the model can learn from imagesthe main hypothesis is that the model can learn from theimages provided and we can extract meaningful information.to test this, as it wasn’t known what elements were drivingperformance in this dataset, we artificially inflated the targetvariable of images with common characteristics. this artificialinflation, henceforth referred to as boosting, was done atdifferent levels, where the level corresponds to adding themean performance multiplied by a factor to the performancescores of the selected images. the dataset with the boostedsamples is used to retrain the model which is then comparedagainst the non-boosted model using unseen images madeusing anvil. the difference between the boosted and non-boosted predictions gives an indication as to whether the modelhas learned the boosted characteristic.table ii: characteristics for boosted models.characteristic variantsvehicle colour red (boosted), white, yellow, silver, blue, blacksetting

better when wetrained it on curated dataset by boosting likes of the imageswith a red car. we utilise red cars in the example as this is avery easy visual parameter to ascertain and evaluate, but thismethod can be used to test any other characteristics. in fig 2we show two more tests we did, one for determining whetherthe model could learn about pictures with cars and humansstanding around them and a suite of testing for image settings(urban, desert, forest, coastal and racetrack). we can show thateven with a relatively small number of boosted images (.less than 1% of the data contained forests) we are able topush the model to comprehend that forests in the backgroundimprove performance.b. hypothesis b: image characteristics drive performancehaving confirmed that the model can learn and we canextract that information, we proceeded to identify what wasdriving performance for this particular dataset. the hypothesishere being that there is some characteristic(s) in these imagesthat viewers consistently like.by editing images consistently, we explored the effect ofpresence of people, vehicle colour, vehicle type and setting.fig. 8 shows the results of this investigation, indicating howthe presence of people impacts negatively the performance ofan image, users prefer silver and black cars, racetracks andurban settings perform lower than other settings, and finallythat users do not like suvs.this methodology effectively allows us to perform a/btesting on any permutation of characteristics in an image. bygenerating more and more images, we are able to increase theconfidence in statements such as ”black cars perform betterthan yellow cars”. through our anvil pipeline, hundredsof variants can be created thus allowing us to to investigateaccurately which components of the image drive results.v. c onclusionin this paper we propose an ai pipeline for predicting the2024 19th annual system of systems engineering conference (sose)138authorized licensed use

targetingindividual sellers who usually lack sufficientexperience in e-commerce. individual sellersoften struggle to compose proper descriptionsfor selling products. with the recent advance-ment of multimodal large language models(mllms), we attempt to integrate such state-of-the-art generative ai technologies into theproduct listing process. to this end, we developipl, an intelligent product listing tool tailoredto generate descriptions using various productattributes such as category, brand, color, condi-tion, etc. ipl enables users to compose prod-uct descriptions by merely uploading photosof the selling product. more importantly, itcan imitate the content style of our c2c plat-form xianyu1. this is achieved by employingdomain-specific instruction tuning on mllms,and by adopting the multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) process. a com-prehensive empirical evaluation demonstratesthat the underlying model of ipl significantlyoutperforms the base model in domain-specifictasks while producing less hallucination. iplhas been successfully deployed in our produc-tion system, where 72% of users have their pub-lished product listings based on the generatedcontent, and those product listings are shownto have a quality score % higher than thosewithout ai assistance.1 introductionwith the rise of the circular economy, second-hand e-commerce has played a vital role in ourdaily lives. unlike business-to-consumer (b2c)*these authors contributed equally to this work.†work done during an internship at alibaba group.‡corresponding author: shuguang han (email:)1xianyu is the largest c2c e-commerce platform inchina.figure 1: intelligent product listing on c2c platformse-commerce (., amazon, walmart), second-hand e-commerce is often operating in the form ofconsumer-to-consumer (c2c) transactions. dif-ferent from professional sellers on b2c platforms,individual sellers in second-hand marketplaces areusually inexperienced. they face unique chal-lenges when listing their products — navigatingthrough the complicated listing procedure, and cre-ating high-quality product descriptions. these is-sues not only affect the success rate of productlistings but also impact the overall quality and dis-coverability of the listed products.to address the above issues, it is imperative tosimplify the listing process for individual usersby leveraging automation to generate high-qualityproduct descriptions. a typical product listing pro-cess involves users manually filling in basic prod-uct attributes, uploading product photos, and com-posing content descriptions. among these steps,preparing product photos is relatively straightfor-ward. if we can automatically generate product de-scriptions based on the uploaded photos, it wouldsignificantly reduce the listing effort and enhance697user experience, as illustrated by figure 1.fortunately, product photos contain a wealth ofinformation, enabling us to infer basic attribute in-formation such as category, brand, and model fromthe imagery in most cases. moreover, recent ad-vancements in multimodal large language models(mllms) (bai et al., 2023b; achiam et al., 2023)have significantly improved both visual understand-ing and natural language generation capabilities,making it feasible to generate product descriptionsbased on product photos in an automatic manner.several large e-commerce platforms, includingebay (herold et al., 2024) and amazon (jiang et al.,2024), have begun to explore this direction by intro-ducing product listing assistants. however, thesetools are still in their infant stages. they still re-quire substantial user input, and the generated con-tent is commonly in the professional marketingstyles which lowers the information authenticityfor a c2c platform. in the context of second-hande-commerce, we encounter more challenges.lack of domain knowledge. to generate high-quality product descriptions, models must possessstrong capabilities for domain understanding (es-cursell et al., 2021; poerner et al., 2019). c2c e-commerce differs from traditional b2c platforms,its product listings often exhibit more unique andvaried characteristics. unlike professional mar-keting descriptions that emphasize persuasive lan-guage, product descriptions in c2c platforms typi-cally exhibit a more colloquial style, focusing oninformation authenticity. this helps foster trust be-tween buyers and sellers and potentially facilitatestransactions. however, existing mllms often fallshort in these areas.hallucination problem. ideally, users onlyneed to upload a photo, and the corresponding con-tent description including core product attributes isautomatically generated. however, achieving thisgoal imposes a significant challenge on the currentmllms (liang et al., 2022; ji et al., 2023). in prac-tice, mllms sometimes produce product attributesgoing beyond the image itself. this is known asthe hallucination problem in large language mod-els(llms). as the core part of the product listingexperience, we need to find a proper solution.challenges for production deployment. de-ploying generative llms on production systems,particularly for applications with a large-scale userbase, imposes high requirements on system latency,cost consumption (kwon et al., 2023), and contentsafety (perez and ribeiro, 2022). meeting thesedemands necessitates a comprehensive system en-gineering effort.to address the above issues, we develop anintelligent product listing ( ipl) system, aiming toimprove the efficiency and effectiveness for prod-uct listings on our production system.firstly, we present a notable case study of in-jecting domain knowledge into a mllm throughfurther instruction tuning of an open-source model.our domain-specific model significantly enhancesthe base model’s understanding of domain knowl-edge and enables it to generate product descriptionsin the unique style characteristic of c2c platforms.secondly, we introduce an innovative multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) ap-proach for visual-based content generation, lever-aging identical product retrieval, to enhance de-scription quality and mitigate hallucination risks inpractical applications.finally, we have successfully deployed the sys-tem in an online environment, delivering servicesto real-world individual users. this system demon-strates high user acceptance and effectively en-hances the efficiency and quality of product list-ings.our extensive empirical studies demonstrate thatipl has the potential to transform the landscapeof product listings, offering a robust, scalable solu-tion to challenges faced by individual sellers andplatforms alike.2 approachthe overall architecture of our intelligent prod-uct listing system can be illustrated in figure 2,which comprises an online multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (rag) process for identify-ing similar products, and an offline-trained domain-specific mllm for product description generation.in our product listing system, user-uploaded pho-tos undergo category prediction, retrieval of simi-lar products, and extraction of key attributes (.,brand, model, etc.) from the descriptions of thesesimilar products. subsequently, the product photo,category, and extracted attributes are fed into thedomain-specific mllm as contextual informationto generate the product description. with this auto-matically generated description, users only need tomake minimal adjustments to complete the product 2: overview of the intelligent product listing (ipl) system architecture. domain-specific model trainingthe crucial stages in training domain-specific mod-els include the construction of training data and theprocess of model instruction tuning. domain instruction tuning datathe training data for the model encompasses prod-uct description generation, domain content under-standing, and general instruction tasks. the generalinstruction data are derived from both automati-cally generated and open-source data. an overviewof the training data is provided in table 1.data type size source modalityproduct description

visual-language, text onlyall  mixture visual-language, text onlytable 1: instruction tuning training datathe description generation dataset, which consti-tutes the primary focus of this work, involves gener-ating descriptions based on user-provided productphotos. by cleaning data from actual user-postedproduct listings, we obtained pairs of product pho-tos and descriptions. subsequently, we convertedthe data into various types of instruction formats,including generating product descriptions directlyfrom photos and generating descriptions based ona combination of product photos, key attribute tem-plates, and reference information, as illustrated intable 2. detailed data construction procedures areprovided in appendix.the content understanding tasks primarily in-clude fundamental tasks in e-commerce scenarios,especially those on c2c platforms, aimed at en-hancing the model’s domain knowledge. thesetasks include product image category prediction,product attribute extraction, and text similaritymatching, among others. this data is derived frommanually annotated data accumulated over time inbusiness scenarios. further details on the data canbe found in appendix.finally, the general instruction dataset are usedto enable the model to retain general capabilitiesand enhance its generalization ability. we employlarge language models to generate general instruc-tions and answers in the native language basedon product photos, while also incorporating high-quality open-source academic datasets as supple-mentary resources. for further details, please referto appendix. model trainingwe chose alibaba’s qwen-vl(bai et al., 2023b)model as the base model, primarily due to itsstrong performance in the native language and itsrobust open-source ecosystem. we employed full-parameter fine-tuning for model training, freezingthe visual encoder module while updating the vl-adapter and llm components only (7b parame-ters).the training objectives focused on classic nexttoken generation for language model optimization,specifically excluding loss calculation for promptprefixes and focusing on the special markers andthe model output tokens. the objective can beformally defined as:l=−t/summationdisplayt=1logp(yt|y<t, x) (1)where xdenotes the model input instructions,yrepresents the generated tokens, trefers to theposition within the generated sequence, and tisthe length of the final generated sequence. furthertraining details can be found in appendix b. online retriever-augmented generationin the online phase, the fine-tuned domain model iscapable of generating descriptions for product pho-699tos. to further mitigate hallucinations, our instruc-tions are not to directly generate descriptions fromproduct photos but to refer to product categories,core attribute templates, and retrieved information,as detailed in table 2.generation with reference informationprompt: you are an experienced seller on asecond-hand trading platform and need to postacell phone category with the product imageas shown in the picture, and the copy templateisbrand + model + storage capacity + color+ version + screen condition. in which, thebrand is

generationwith retriever-augmented generation.therefore, in online scenario, product descrip-tion generation is a retrieval-augmented gener-ation (rag) process. we conduct category pre-diction on the input product photos and simultane-ously retrieve identical products through vector re-trieval. from the retrieved products, we extract keyattribute values to serve as reference informationfor generating descriptions. the extraction of keyattribute values is accomplished using a domain-specific large model we trained, with the promptshown in table 3. key attribute sets for each cate-gory are derived from offline mining and manualsummarization, and can be retrieved through prod-uct category queries. by incorporating attributestemplate into the instructions, we can further con-trol the attributes and their sequence that the modelmust mention in the generated product descriptions,ensuring the richness of the information in the out-put descriptions.the category prediction model utilizes the al-bef network architecture(li et al., 2021; zhanget al., 2018), a classic vision-language multimodalmodel. the model has been pre-trained on domain-specific data and fine-tuned with millions of man-ually annotated datasets, achieving an accuracy ofover 80% across tens of thousands of categories.the implementation of the visual search drawsupon the work conducted by (zhang et al.,

checks on generated descriptions to preventnon-compliant content, thereby effectively avoid-ing public opinion risks. for more detailed errordetection and exception handling, please refer toappendix d.4 experiment dataour experimental data comprises both domain-specific and general datasets. all data were sourcedfrom real e-commerce scenarios and the targetlabels were either manually annotated or con-firmed by actual platform users, then convertedinto instruction format. we constructed validation700datasets encompassing tasks such as sentiment anal-ysis, information extraction, content topic selection,tagging/classification, and attribute-based visualquestion answering within the e-commerce domain(for more details, refer to appendix e). addition-ally, we included datasets specifically designed toevaluate generative style and hallucination. modeldomain-specific models: to assess the effective-ness of domain knowledge injection, we trainedseveral models with varying amounts of trainingdata. the datasets were randomly shuffled andtruncated. the comparison models include: qwen-vl (baseline, without domain training), 10% data(trained with 10% of the data), 20% data, 50%data, and 100% data.online rag system: in addressing hallucinationalleviation, we conducted experiments on variouscomponents of our online rag system. this in-cluded evaluating the use of product category in-formation, reference information from identical orsimilar products. metricsour evaluation encompasses comprehensive met-rics to assess different aspects of model perfor-mance:n-gram-based metrics : we employed bleu (pa-pineni et al., 2002), rouge and rouge-l (lin,2004) to evaluate the alignment of generated textwith ground truth product descriptions.semantic similarity metrics : bert embed-dings measured semantic similarity (sim) betweenmodel outputs and ground truth using bert-score.task-specific accuracy metrics : these metricswere used for domain-specific knowledge ques-tions, assessing model accuracy in understandingand responding to task-specific prompts.human assessment: evaluation was conductedby experts in the c2c domain, assessing whetherthe generated descriptions adhere to domain-specific style and identify key attributes(chen et al.,2024) accurately. we perform a quantitative analy-sis of the results.5 resultsin the following subsections, we discuss the fivekey research questions regarding our domain modeland the online rag system:•q1: does the domain-specific model, afterinstruction tuning, exhibit a stronger under-standing of domain knowledge?•q2: does the domain-specific model generateproduct descriptions with a more distinct c2cdomain style?•q3: can the model maintain its general capa-bilities after being trained on domain-specificdata?•q4: does the online rag mitigate hallucina-tions in product description generation?•q5: how does the ipl system perform inreal-world online scenarios?among them, q1-q3 investigate the effects of do-main knowledge injection, q4 explores the role ofonline rag, and q5 addresses online performance. rq1: enhanced domain-specificknowledgeto evaluate the model’s understanding of domain-specific knowledge, we compared its performanceon c2c e-commerce tasks involving both language-only and visual-language hybrid modalities. asshown in table 4, the domain-specific model sig-nificantly outperforms baseline across various met-rics. notably, the model shows substantial improve-ments in tasks such as e-commerce topic selectionand category recognition, while the gains in senti-ment analysis are relatively smaller. this can beattributed to the close alignment of sentiment clas-sification with general tasks, as well as its superiorbaseline performance.by truncating the training data to 10%, 20%,50%, and 100% of the original dataset, we obtaineddifferent models. the model trained with the fulldataset achieved the highest average accuracy, fol-lowed by the model trained with 50% of the data.in the topic selection and category recognitiontasks, the accuracy increased significantly withthe amount of training data. for the content tag-ging and vision-based product attribute extrac-tion tasks, accuracy improved significantly afteradding 20% of the data, but showed minor fluctua-tions with further increases in training data beyond20%. rq2: enhanced domain-specific stylegeneration abilitywe also evaluated whether the model’s generatedlistings exhibit domain-specific stylistic elements.given that style preferences are subjective, humanevaluation is the most reliable method. an experi-enced

text-based product attribute extraction (tae).paring the linguistic style of listings generated bydifferent models for the same product and castingvotes. the results, presented in table 5, indicatea significant preference for our model’s outputs.in contrast, qwen-vl’s listings were often per-ceived as unnatural, verbose, and overly marketing-oriented, which is undesirable in c2c personalseller scenarios. we also experimented with var-ious prompts for qwen-vl to mitigate prompt-induced biases. rq3: retains general capabilitieswe assessed the model’s retention of general ca-pabilities using well-established benchmarks suchas mmbench (liu et al., 2023) , mme(fu et al.,2023), and seedbench(li et al., 2024), drawing ref-erence from the work of llav a  and qwen-vl.our model outperforms llav a  and qwen-vlon the mmbench task, and achieves performanceclosely comparable to llav a  on the mmetask. however, it demonstrates relatively weakerperformance on the seedbench task.on one hand, seedbench focuses on detailed im-age analysis tasks, including scene understanding,instance identity, instance location, instance count-ing. in contrast, mmbench emphasizes overallimage analysis, encompassing tasks such as imagetopic and attribute recognition. our training sam-ples are based on commonly used general-domaindata and additionally incorporate e-commerce prod-uct understanding, encompassing tasks such ascategory recognition and product attribute extrac-tion. from the perspective of the high-quality train-ing samples, this demonstrates a greater improve-ment for mmbench compared to the seedbench the other hand, the difficulty of the tasksreveals that seedbench is indeed more challenging,as detailed image analysis requires the model topossess strong pixel resolution, multi-object recog-nition capabilities, and spatial recognition  model still has space for improvement onthese tasks. the generalization obtained from ex-isting universal samples aids in enhancing bothinstruction-following abilities and image recogni-tion capabilities. therefore, we will continue torefine these abilities in our future work.model win:loss win rateours vs qwen-vl 948:101 %table

evaluation: based on productphotos, user-generated descriptions, and model-generated descriptions, evaluators are required toassess the accuracy of the attributes (., brand,model) in the model outputs. subsequently, we cancompute the accuracy rate.machine automatic evaluation: the content gen-erated by the model was compared to the user-written descriptions using metrics such as sim,bleu and rouge.the specific results are shown in table 7.as opposed to only giving the image to themllms, our model significantly improved all met- in the human manual evaluation ofattribute accuracy,

effectively mitigates hal-lucination. this indicates that the information ob-tained solely from product images is limited and ne-cessitates supplementary references. on the otherhand, the direct contribution of product categoriesis relatively minor. the primary function of cate-gory prediction is to obtain the relevant attributestemplate, thereby enhancing the controllability ofthe generation process in rag. rq5: online a/b test resultsto evaluate the performance of the ipl system, weconducted online a/b testing. the objective was tomeasure the adoption rate of product descriptionsgenerated by ipl and to compare the advantagesover not using ipl. our experiments demonstratea high user acceptance rate for our system: up to72% of users are willing to continue modifying theautomatically generated descriptions to completeproduct listings, and over 32% of users adopt morethan 50% of the generated content. furthermore,products utilizing the auto-description generationfeature exhibit a % improvement in overall qual-ity scores compared to similar products that do notuse this feature. the product quality score, an inter-nal metric used by the platform to assess productquality, is primarily calculated based on the rich-ness of descriptions and the aesthetic authenticityof photos. the details of the quality score definitioncan be found in appendix.6 related workmultimodal llm: recent advances in large lan-guage models such as gpt-4, llama(touvronet al., 2023), and qwen(bai et al., 2023a), havedemonstrated impressive capabilities in understand-ing world knowledge and generating diverse text.these models have shown significant potential inzero-shot or few-shot(wang et al., 2020) learningscenarios, exhibiting strong instruction-followingabilities(ouyang et al., 2022). recent works, in-cluding blip-2(li et al., 2023), minigpt-4(zhuet al., 2023), and qwen-vl(bai et al., 2023b), haveexplored integrating visual and textual modalitiesfrom various perspectives. however, these modelslack training on domain-specific (c2c) private data,resulting in insufficient domain understanding andinconsistent domain-specific style outputs, whichlimits their effectiveness in related tasks.retrieval-augmented generation: hallucina-tion remains a major challenge in the develop-ment of llms(guerreiro et al., 2023)(ji et al.,2023). approaches such as visualgpt(wu et al.,2023), hugginggpt(shen et al., 2024), and tool-former(schick et al., 2024) leverage existing ma-ture modules to perform complex operations. an-other method, involves text retrieval-based aug-mentation(guu et al., 2020; izacard et al., 2023;robertson et al., 2009; karpukhin et al., 2020),where external resources(guu et al., 2020) or web-retrieved(nakano et al., 2021) texts are fed intothe prompts to provide llms with more accu-rate (mallen et al., 2022; kandpal et al., 2023)ref-erence information to mitigate hallucinations(liet al., 2022; kang and choi, 2023). unlike thesemethods, our research uniquely integrates visual-based retrieval augmentation with mllms and suc-cessfully applies it in the e-commerce domain, ad-dressing the hallucination problem while enhancingtask-specific performance.7 conclusionwe presented ipl system, a novel framework thatgenerates high-quality, accurate product descrip-tions based on images, enhancing item listing effi-ciency in the c2c market. by leveraging mllmstrained via domain injection, our model gainsdeeper domain-specific knowledge and style com-pared to the original model (qwen-vl). the im-plementation of online rag, which uses similarproduct images as reference, reduces hallucinationin mllms, resulting in more precise descriptions.the effectiveness of our framework is demonstratedthrough human evaluations, machine assessments,and online a/b  limitationsour ipl system generates precise descriptions tai-lored to individual seller styles, streamlining theposting process and enhancing the quality of list-ings. our system exhibits notable potential forfurther optimization. firstly, the core attributestemplate is predominantly based on extensive de-scriptive statistics and do not yet account for per-sonalized user posting styles. secondly, the accu-racy of generated descriptions for certain long-tailcategories requires improvement. to advance oursystem, we intend to incorporate additional train-ing samples from long-tail categories and integrateuser personalization data. this approach aims to en-hance the accuracy and personalization of productdescriptions, thereby increasing adoption rates andaiding users in efficiently producing high-quality, steven adler, sandhini agarwal, lamaahmad, ilge akkaya, florencia leoni aleman,diogo

(2020)found that ai-generated ads using emotional appeals were evaluated lower than those created by designers, but evaluations were not different when ads used rational appeals. these mixed findings suggest that the influence of ai disclosures may depend on the task and the context (baek et al., 2024 ; wu et al., 2024 ).a key characteristic of services is their intangibility, which refers to the aspects of a service offering that are impalpable, subjective, impossible to touch or try on (shostack, 1977 ), and thus difficult to fully understand (wirtz et al., 2021 ). service ads use tangibilization to make it easier for the consumer to understand the service experience (bambauer-sachse and heinzle, 2018 ) and to enhance marketing out-comes such as more positive attitudes toward the brand (leong et al., 2018 ), perceived service quality and purchase intentions (clow et al., 2006 ; hill et al., 2004 ).the message source, or the entity the audience believes is the sender of the advertising message, is an important part of successful tangibili -zation. source credibility theory argues that two components influence the effectiveness of a message source: 1) trustworthiness, related to perceptions of the source’s relevant expertise and honesty (baek et al., 2024 ), and 2) attractiveness, related to the perceptions that the source is likeable and similar to the audience (stafford et al., 2002 ). research has found that when a message source is trustworthy and likable to the audience, the source positively influences consumers’ belief in the ad claims and valence of attitudes toward the ad (shareef et al., 2019 ). further, a source that provides concrete cues about the service experi -ence helps consumers understand the service process and benefits (bakri et al., 2020 ).when consumers view a genai advertisement with no ai disclosure, the brand serves as the message source. without additional information from other sources, the ad’s persuasiveness would be similar to a typical designer-created ad. when an ai disclosure is present on an ad, it in-dicates ai’s involvement in its creation. this introduces ai as a message source because the disclosure reveals how the ad was made and where the information in the ad originated. ai performance is often judged as unproven and unclear, eliciting higher uncertainty from consumers (lee and kim, 2024 ), as they worry about the “accuracy, authenticity, bias, or manipulation” of ai (erskine et al., 2023 , p. 1). uncertainty is negatively related to source credibility (byun et al., 2021 ). in the ai service ad context, a less positive attitude occurs because uncertainty from the ad source reduces service tangibilization, increasing the difficulty to verify and evaluate service experience (guo and wang, 2024 ). h1. service ads with ai disclosure labels will generate less positive attitudes compared to the same service ads with no disclosure labels.. mediating role of trusttrust in the context of services has extensively focused on the con-sumer’s belief in the service provider’s reliability, competence, and quality to deliver what is promised (chiou and droge, 2006 ; huang et al., 2024 ). service providers, thus, are an important source of trust. when consumers view a service ad, source credibility theory suggests that consumers will rely on the source of the ad to determine trust because the ad helps consumers judge the service provider’s intentions and ability to deliver (baek et al., 2024 ). if an ad is ai-generated, due to the skepticism associated with ai technology (erskine et al., 2023 ), consumers may be less likely to trust factual information developed by ai (glikson and woolley, 2020 ), leading to less positive attitudes and less desirable behavioral responses (arango et al., 2023 ; hussain et al., 2020 ). thus, we propose that when an advertisement is disclosed as ai-generated, it shifts the primary source of the ad message from a real service brand (high trust) to ai (low trust). lower trust is associated with less positive attitudes toward the ad (hussain et al., 2020 ). stated formally. h2. the influence of ai disclosure on ad attitudes will be mediated by trust.. moderating effect of service ad focus on trustmost services feature a bundle of intangible and tangible attributes (., inpatient care has hospital facilities and interactions between pa-tients and health professionals). intangible attributes, typically the ser-vice providers themselves, contact consumers actively, customize the service (mersha, 1990 ), and build relationships with consumers (güntürkün et al., 2020 ). conversely, tangible attributes, typically the service environment and equipment, contact consumers passively and do not result in customization (mersha, 1990 ) or relational bonds. based on this distinction between service attribute types, we conceptualize service ads can be either intangibility-focused (., a dentistry ad emphasizing the dentist’s image, whose skills and friendliness are intangible attributes) or tangibility-focused (., a dentistry ad featuring only tangible attributes such as a dentist’s office with typical dental care equipment).to highlight specific attributes in service ads with different foci, vi-sual cues are often employed because visually emphasized information becomes more salience in consumers’ memory (pooresmaeili et al., 2014 ), influencing their evaluation of the ad and the advertised brand (bordalo et al., 2022 ). intangibility-focused service ads usually highlight the service provider that is positioned as the source of the message, making the service provider more salient and the central focus for consumer evaluation. conversely, tangibility-focused service ads emphasize the service environment as the focal point for evaluation.differences are expected when consumers evaluate these service ads. when intangible attributes (., a service provider) are shown in an ad, tangibilization occurs through association (berry and clark, 1986 ; utkarsh and medhavi, 2016 ), which links the person featured in the ad to the service. consumers will evaluate the service provider’s reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy (., the intangible servqual dimensions, parasuraman et al., 1985 ) to determine trust and judge service quality. however, when tangible attributes are shown in a ser-vice ad, tangibilization occurs through physical representation (berry and clark, 1986 ; gilbert and stafford, 2022 ), which illustrates the ser-vice environment, including physical facilities and equipment (., the tangible servqual dimension). thus, when the ai-disclosure label is absent, an intangibility-focused ad should be just as effective at building trust as a tangibility-focused ad. however, when the ai-disclosure label is present, given the relational bond that consumers expect to have with the service provider and the importance of trust for building relation -ships (balakrishnan and dwivedi, 2021 ), we expect that an intangibility-focused ad will result in significantly less trust compared to a tangibility-focused ad. stated formally. h3. ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus will interact to influence trust in the service brand. when the disclosure label is present, an intangibility-focused ad is expected to generate lower trust compared to a tangibility-focused ad. when the disclosure label is absent, no dif-ferences in trust are expected.h4. the interaction between ai disclosure label and service ad focus will influence consumer attitude toward the service ad through trust in the service. grigsby et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               journal of retailing and consumer services 84 (2025) 104231. moderating effect of intangible attribute creation source on trustwe propose that one way to mitigate the less positive attitudes to-ward ai-generated service ads is to use genai exclusively to generate imagery associated with the tangible attributes in the ad and to disclose the selective application of ai in the disclosure label (., a label stating: “the background in this ad was developed using ai. the photo of the dentist was not developed using ai”).for such attenuation to occur, full transparency in disclosure labels by indicating which elements in the ads are real and which are ai- generated is needed. transparency in communicating brand ’s business practices indicates brand openness and accountability, helping trust- building (lin et al., 2017 ; wang and qiu, 2024 ). however, although ai disclosure signals transparency, skepticism about the technology ’s reliability may still be a barrier for consumers to fully trust ai-generated information (glikson and woolley, 2020 ), as we hypothesized earlier. contrast this to when consumers observe an ai disclosure on a service ad for which the intangible attribute is not generated by ai: since intangible attributes are key service differentiators (ding and keh, 2017 ), if they are not ai-generated and this information is disclosed in service ads, such transparency preserves source credibility. hence, we expect that disclosing ai’s non-involvement in creating intangible attributes in service ads will have no negative impact on trust.to illustrate how intangibility of service attributes and ai disclosure label transparency impact trust, consider a dentistry ad depicting an ai- generated office with dental care equipment (., tangible attributes) as background and a dentist (., intangible attribute) as foreground, either created using ai or using a real person ’s photo. when the ai disclosure label is absent, there will be no trust differences regardless of how the ad was created. ai label presence will influence trust depending on the contents of the label itself. specifically, when the entire ad was developed using ai and the label confirms this, we expect that our findings will replicate our prior studies: trust should be lower when compared to the conditions in which the ai label is absent. however, when only the tangible attributes in the background of the ad were ai- generated and the depicted service provider was not (which is explained by the disclosure label), we expect that trust will be just as high as when the disclosure label is absent. finally, different degrees of trust will lead to different valences of attitudes toward the ad. stated formally.  disclosure label and intangible attribute creation source will interact to influence trust in the service brand. when the disclosure label is present, consumers are expected to have lower trust in an ad with ai- generated intangible attributes compared to an ad featuring intangible attributes with real images. when the disclosure label is absent, no differences in trust are expected. interaction between ai disclosure label and intangible attri-bute creation source will influence consumer attitude toward the service ad through trust in the service brand. of studiesacross three studies, we demonstrate that ai disclosure label pres-ence (vs. absence) leads to less positive ad attitudes through reduced trust in the advertised service brand. we also examine two moderators that influence trust (see fig. 1). all the scales used in the three studies are from prior research (see table 1for scale items). all the ads were created using the image generative ai tool dreamstudio.across the three studies, to account for the possibility of common method bias, we relied on two approaches. first, the harman single- factor method was used (., sengoz et al., 2024 ). in neither study did the largest explanatory power of the first factor exceed 40%. second, we computed the vifs of each explanatory variable in each study, and none of the vifs exceeded 5 (., wong and wong, 2024 ). as such, there is no evidence to indicate common method bias in the three studies. finally, the sample sizes across studies were reviewed using the g*power application, and we concluded that no study was underpowered. 1. pretest 1we pretested three restaurant ads and three restaurant names. a total of 150 participants (% male, % female, % nonbinary; mage 40) were recruited through the cloudresearch connect platform and fig.  of. grigsby et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               journal of retailing and consumer services 84 (2025) 1042314randomly assigned to view one ad and one restaurant name. we measured participants ’ attitudes to the ad, ad attractiveness, image appropriateness for a restaurant ad, and the extent to which participants believed the ad was developed by ai.no significant differences emerged among the three ads on the ad- related measures, but ad 3 (m ) was rated marginally as less likely to be ai-generated than ad 1 (m , p .11) and ad 2 (m , p .06). thus, ad 3 was selected. two restaurant names (varela and fremont place) were rated as equally appropriate. varela was selected because previous research found it to be an unfamiliar brand (grigsby et al., 2023 ). fig. 2shows the final. study 1 design and resultsparticipants and procedure. study 1 employed a single-factor design (ai disclosure label: absent vs. present). a total of 210 participants (% male, % female, % nonbinary; mage 39) were recruited through the cloudresearch connect platform and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. participants who missed an attention check (“the researchers would like you to select strongly disagree for this question ”) were excluded from analysis, resulting in a final sample of 201 participants. after viewing the assigned advertisement, participants reported their attitude towards the ad and perceived trust towards the advertised restaurant. ai detection was captured for use as a manipu -lation check. demographics (age, gender, english as a first language), restaurant consumption frequency, and ad attractiveness were captured for use as covariates since these variables could influence participants ’ interest in and evaluation of the advertised restaurant (raoofpanah et al., 2023 ).results. an independent samples t-test found that the ai disclosure label manipulation was successful; participants in the disclosure absent condition (m ) rated that ad as less likely to be ai-generated compared to those in the disclosure present condition (m , t () , p ).covariates for the one-way ancova were restaurant consumption frequency (r .82), perceived ad attractiveness (r .82), age, gender, and english as a first language (estimated marginal means are reported). as expected, attitudes (cronbach ’s α .96) toward the ad were more positive when the label was absent (m ) compared to when the label was present (m , f(1, 193) , p ), supporting h1. mediation through trust (process model 4, hayes, 2018 ) was sup-ported at the 90% confidence level (indirect effect:.13, 90% ci:.29 to .0045), providing marginal support for h2.discussion. study 1 suggested that ai disclosure resulted in less pos-itive attitudes toward the ad (h1) and provided marginal support for trust as the mediating process (h2). study 2 explores these effects using different service ads with either an intangibility-focus or a tangibility- focus. 2. pretest 2a dental service was selected because the dentist (., intangible attribute) is more important than their clinic room (., the tangible attribute). pretest 2 was conducted to select two dentistry advertise -ments, focusing on the dentist and his office, respectively, as well as to test the appropriateness of the dentistry name.six dentistry advertisements were created, ads 1–3 focusing on a dentist (three different dentist images) and ads 4–6 only showing a dental clinic room (three different room images). a total of 303 partic -ipants (% male, % female, 1% nonbinary; mage 39) were recruited through cloudresearch connect. they were randomly assigned to view one of the six advertisements, and then reported their attitudes toward the ad, ad attractiveness, image appropriateness, and ai detection. next, participants were shown the name “varela dentistry ” and rated its appropriateness. it was desirable to choose a set of ads (one with and one without a service provider) that were equal on the mea-surements included in the pretest. we chose the only set in which both ads met this requirement (all p-values ) for use in study 2 (see fig. 3for final stimuli).. study 2 design and resultsparticipants and procedure. study 2 employed a 2 (ai disclosure label: absent vs. present) x 2 (service ad focus: tangible vs. intangible attri-bute) between-subjects design. a total of 402 participants (% male, 46% female, % nonbinary;

an inde-pendent samples t-test found that participants in the disclosure absent condition (m ) perceived the ad as less likely to be ai-generated than those in the disclosure present condition (m , t() , p ).covariates for the two-way ancova were dentist visit frequency (r .75), perceived attractiveness of the ad (r .73), age, gender, and english as a first language (estimated marginal means are reported). these covariates were selected as they could influence participants ’ interest in and evaluation of the advertised dentist (white et al., 2020 ). the interaction between ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus on trust (cronbach ’s α .96) was significant (f(1, 368) , p ), in support of h3. specifically, with an ai disclosure, trust was significantly lower in the intangibility-focused ad featuring the dentist (mdentist ) than in the tangibility-focused ad featuring the clinic room (mroom , f(1, 184) , p ). without a disclosure, no differences emerged (mdentist , mroom , p ). mediation (h4), such that the interaction between ai disclosure label presence and service ad focus influence ad attitudes (cronbach ’s α .98) through trust toward the service provider, was also supported (process model 7, index of moderated mediation .29, 95% ci:.55 to .06; see fig. 4). when the service ad focus was tangible, the con-ditional indirect effect was not significant (effect .05, 95% ci:.23 to.11). when the service ad focus was intangible, the conditional indirect was significant, as expected (effect .34, 95% ci:.56 to .16).discussion. study 2 found that the focus of the service ad moderated the effect of ai disclosure on trust in the advertised service brand. as predicted, ai disclosure labels reduced trust in intangible-focused ads more than tangible-focused ads. our results also show support for trust as the mediating process. both studies 1 and 2 reveal the negative effects of ai disclosure. how to attenuate this effect is investigated in study 3. 3. pretest 3pretest 3 was conducted to find a label for an ad design with an intangible attribute creation source that was real (., a photo) against an ai-generated background. we designed two dentistry ads with identical ai-generated backgrounds (., a dental clinic room) but two different dentist sources: one ai-generated (ad 1) and one real dentist in a photo (ad 2). since ad 1 was entirely ai-generated, it had our previ -ously tested label, “this ad was developed using ai.” for ad 2, we designed three different label variation conditions: 1) “the background in this ad was developed using ai.”;

advertising re-search is understanding when and why digital assets such aspromotional content perform well during a marketing push.by leveraging raw image feature vectors extracted from largedatasets, we can train performance prediction models usingonline social signals such as likes or views. while the resultingmodels make accurate predictions, they are opaque and rely onabstract features within the model, making attribution almostimpossible. this paper demonstrates an approach to performanceprediction modelling for image based digital creative assets.utilising a combination of pre-trained vision model embeddingswith a pipeline of generative artificial intelligence (ai) for imagesynthesis and manipulation, we establish a means of determiningthe performance of explainable components. this enables flexibleperformance prediction, even with smaller datasets, with highdegree of explainability through the attribution of image featurescorrelating with high or low performance.index terms

resonate with consumers is critical, but predicting thepotential performance of marketing assets is a complex prob-lem. this requires a careful understanding of the individualfactors contributing to consumer response, not just predictingwhat will perform well, but why. the ideal system would beable to:1) understand what characteristics are in an image (hence-forth referred to as an asset),2) accurately predict its performance (as measured in likes,clicks, views, etc.),3) be interpretable, allowing the user to attribute perfor-mance to specific characteristics in the asset.approaches based on neural networks like a convolutionalneural net (cnn) [1] or an multi-layer perceptron (mlp)[2] have been shown to give state-of-the-art accuracy in per-formance modelling. these networks can in turn leverage theembeddings of other vision models that are trained on millionsof images to create a nuanced prediction of performance.whilst this increases prediction accuracy, the models behaveas black boxes with no feature attribution capability.if we want to prioritise attribution, we can switch toinputs that are human-readable, such as one-hot encoded tagsextracted either manually or by using other ai systems likeobject detection models. this approach increases explainabil-ity as it can provide importance scores for all the input tagsfrom which we can determine the effect of elements in theimage on the performance prediction. however, methods basedon extraction of tags are restrictive and do not cover subtleelements that might contribute to the prediction and thusinherently less accurate.currently, one can either emphasise on prediction accuracy,or explainability of results. to bridge this gap, we proposea pipeline of various ai systems to leverage neural networksand generative models to achieve state-of-the-art performanceprediction while also creating a flexible and accurate systemfor attribution.the main contribution of this work is a system of ai sys-tems that allows for performance attribution from input vectorsthat were produced in abstract space without compromisingon predictive accuracy. the first part of this system uses apre-trained cnn model backbone to extract feature vectorsfrom images being used in advertisements. the feature vectorsare then passed as inputs to a xgboost model to predictthe target performance variable (likes, clicks etc.). we thenutilise a pipeline (henceforth referred to as anvil) whichcontains generative models that modify the image accordingto specific patterns, creating variations on the original imageby either removing or adding components. these new imagesare generated in line with whichever component we arespecifically testing for attribution. the altered assets are thenfed to the prediction pipeline mentioned earlier to get a newprediction. by carefully and consistently generating variationsof the initial asset, we are able to understand which modifiedcomponents are affecting performance and by how much.this paper is structured as follows. section ii outlinesrelated work. section iii details the proposed pipeline, in-cluding feature extraction, predictive model, and performanceattribution. we then provide an analysis of the results insection iv. the paper ends with conclusions and a discussionon future work in section v.ii. r elated workthe following is a review of machine learning (ml)

simple modelsto correct the errors made by previous models and is optimizedto have high computational efficiency. the model is based ontree algorithm and hence has the ability to assign importancescores to the input variable which can be used in attribution.however, for the importance scores to be usable, input featuresneed to be human-interpretable variables.an ensemble learning technique called random forest [4]combines the predictions from several decision trees to gen-erate a single, more reliable forecast. this kind of supervisedlearning technique is applicable to tasks involving both re-gression and classification. the algorithm uses techniques likebootstrap and aggregation, commonly known as bagging thatenables it to use multiple decision trees. each decision treehas a significant variance, but when we aggregate them all atonce, the variance that results is reduced because each treeis perfectly trained on a specific sample of the data. similarto xgboost random forest also provides importance scoresfor input variables but with the same drawback of these inputvariables have to human interpretability to be useful.gradient-weighted class activation mapping (grad-cam)[5], is a gradient mapping technique that uses the gradientsof any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network orlikes on an instagram in regression network) flowing into thefinal convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization maphighlighting the important regions in the image for predictingthe concept.methods to make tree-based models interpretable have beenproposed by [6] and [7]. whilst these methods would givean indication of the features that contribute the most toperformance, these features need to be human-readable forthe methods to work. in the case of images, the inputs to thetree models above are feature vectors and hence not easilyinterpretable. additionally, ensemble tree-based models relyon multiple ”weak learners” for their predictive accuracy andas such can identify combinations of features that lead to near-perfect predictions. attribution, by definition, requires a smallnumber of individual predictors and as such becomes a moredifficult problem to tackle [8].the algorithms mentioned above either require inputs (likeobject tags) that are extremely reductive or have a verysimplistic mechanism for performance attribution as in thecase with grad-cam. we propose a pipeline of ai systems thatovercome both of these drawbacks to give detailed attributionwith a much richer input.iii. m ethodologyto demonstrate and test the methodology described herein,we have used images posted on the social media accountof a car manufacturer and used the number of likes as thetarget performance variable. as expected, the vast majorityof the images depicted cars in various settings. the datasetconsisted of approximately 13,700 images that were sharedbetween october 2012 and march 2024. the average numberof likes was non-stationary (., changed over time), showinga steady increase up to 2017 after which it stabilized (see fig3). this was likely driven by the growth of the social mediaplatform and of this specific account and not related to theimages themselves. to avoid any issues with non-stationarity,any images pre-2017 ( images) were not used in trainingand testing the prediction model. they were only used as partof testing the attribution methodology.the proposed prediction and attribution pipeline can besubdivided into the following three stages ():a. feature extractionas a first step, we need to extract information from theimages. the preferred method of doing so is by removing theprediction layer from pre-trained vision models and using thedense vector from the truncated model as highly condensedimage features. there are several vision models with very highgeneralizing capabilities trained on big datasets like imagenet[9] that we could have chosen from. primarily, we consideredthe choice between multimodal models like clip [10] andmonomodal models like resnet models. we went with the cliparchitecture as our feature extractor for the following reasons:1) comparisons between resnet200d and clip-vit-base-patch32 showed minimal differences in validation error(see table i);2) clip’s ability to project image features and text featuresin the same space can be useful in interrogating themodel in later experiments;3) the length of the feature vector produced by resnet is4 times larger than the one produced by clip (2048 vs512) and hence clip can be trained on smaller datasetswithout the risk of overfitting.the clip base model uses a vit-l/14 [11] transformerarchitecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention transformer as a text encoder. these encoders aretrained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs viaa contrastive loss function. after extracting features fromthe clip model we use these feature vectors as input to asubsequent model used to predict the performance metricssuch as likes, impressions etc.in addition to the image features, relevant metadata canbe added to the image. whilst our dataset did not containsuch metadata, metadata such as country, media channel,and audience selection are often available in marketing andadvertising datasets. our methodology allows these featuresto be appended to the image features extracted from clip.b. asset performance predictionthe feature vectors are used as inputs to xgboost. asmentioned above, we set the target performance variable asthe number of likes that each image received. in order toobtain the best possible results from xgboost, we normalisedand detrended the target variable. the absolute number oflikes was normalised based on a twelve-month rolling average,removing the effects of seasonality as much as possible. asdiscussed above, the non-stationary part of the data was alsoremoved. we also cube-root transformed the target variable,which gives it a more normal-like distribution. this has theeffect of reducing skewness and decreasing the impact ofoutliers on the model. by making this choice, we accept higher2024 19th annual system of systems

the scores for any other color down. b- our second test correctly pushes the model to comprehendthat people standing next to cars do better, with an average improvement of +43% performance on images

the3 models tested.c. asset performance attribution (anvil)for the attribution stage we use two models for our anvilpipeline to modify elements in the image asset. stable dif-fusion [12] models are a class of generative ai models thatgenerate high-resolution images of varying quality. they workby gradually adding gaussian noise to the original data inthe forward diffusion process and then learning to remove thenoise in the reverse diffusion process. they are latent variablemodels referring to a hidden continuous feature space. theylook similar to variational autoencoders (v aes) [13], and areloosely based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics.controlnet [14] functions as a complete neural networkstructure taking charge of substantial image diffusion models,like stable diffusion, to grasp task-specific input conditions.controlnet achieves this by replicating the weights of a majordiffusion model into both a “trainable copy” and a “lockedcopy.” the locked copy preserves the learned network trainedfrom vast image data, while the trainable copy gets trainedon task-specific datasets to master conditional control. thisprocess connects trainable and locked neural network segmentsusing an exceptional convolution layer called “zero convolu-tion.” in this layer, convolution weights progressively evolvefrom zeros to optimal settings through a learned approach.our generative pipeline segments the image asset andisolates different elements of the image, such as the principleobject(s): the car, models wearing apparels of a brand etc aswell as other supporting elements such as trees, hill, beach etc.after choosing the element, the user can modify it using thefollowing steps: (1) the image is first segmented by a trans-former model for image segmentation [15]. (2) then the userselects the element of the image to be modified. (3) the userpasses the prompt to the controlnet and stable diffusion modelwhich generate a new image with a modified version of theselected element based on the prompt. examples of modifiedimages can be seen in figure 6. anvil allows rapid and batchmanipulation of images using generative ai to quickly createan attribution dataset. by utilizing fully generated imagery aswell as synthetic variations of existing images controlling fora desired attribute, control environments can be generated fortesting most conceivable components. for this paper we havefocused on the social media output of car manufacturers and assuch our performance attribution techniques are more focusedon image manipulation of vehicles and scenes, however thistechnique could be potentially applied to any subject  19th

the predicted performance. a large numberof images can be modified at scale to establish confidence ofattribution. alternatively, since the feature extraction modelused is multi-modal, we can pass sentences containing adescription of an image to the xgboost model. this is a fasterand more consistent method of interrogating the model.iv. r esults and discussiona. hypothesis a: the model can learn from imagesthe main hypothesis is that the model can learn from theimages provided and we can extract meaningful information.to test this, as it wasn’t known what elements were drivingperformance in this dataset, we artificially inflated the targetvariable of images with common characteristics. this artificialinflation, henceforth referred to as boosting, was done atdifferent levels, where the level corresponds to adding themean performance multiplied by a factor to the performancescores of the selected images. the dataset with the boostedsamples is used to retrain the model which is then comparedagainst the non-boosted model using unseen images madeusing anvil. the difference between the boosted and non-boosted predictions gives an indication as to whether the modelhas learned the boosted characteristic.table ii: characteristics for boosted models.characteristic variantsvehicle colour red (boosted), white, yellow, silver, blue, blacksetting

better when wetrained it on curated dataset by boosting likes of the imageswith a red car. we utilise red cars in the example as this is avery easy visual parameter to ascertain and evaluate, but thismethod can be used to test any other characteristics. in fig 2we show two more tests we did, one for determining whetherthe model could learn about pictures with cars and humansstanding around them and a suite of testing for image settings(urban, desert, forest, coastal and racetrack). we can show thateven with a relatively small number of boosted images (.less than 1% of the data contained forests) we are able topush the model to comprehend that forests in the backgroundimprove performance.b. hypothesis b: image characteristics drive performancehaving confirmed that the model can learn and we canextract that information, we proceeded to identify what wasdriving performance for this particular dataset. the hypothesishere being that there is some characteristic(s) in these imagesthat viewers consistently like.by editing images consistently, we explored the effect ofpresence of people, vehicle colour, vehicle type and setting.fig. 8 shows the results of this investigation, indicating howthe presence of people impacts negatively the performance ofan image, users prefer silver and black cars, racetracks andurban settings perform lower than other settings, and finallythat users do not like suvs.this methodology effectively allows us to perform a/btesting on any permutation of characteristics in an image. bygenerating more and more images, we are able to increase theconfidence in statements such as ”black cars perform betterthan yellow cars”. through our anvil pipeline, hundredsof variants can be created thus allowing us to to investigateaccurately which components of the image drive results.v. c onclusionin this paper we propose an ai pipeline for predicting the2024 19th annual system of systems engineering conference (sose)138authorized licensed use

The content generation model represented by AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the advertising industry. This study explores the mechanisms by which the characteristics of AI-generated advertisements affect consumers’ willingness to accept these advertisements from the perspectives of perceived eeriness and perceived intelligence. It found that the verisimilitude and imagination of AI-generated advertisements negatively affect the degree of perceived eeriness by consumers, while synthesis positively affects it. Conversely, verisimilitude, vitality, and imagination positively affect the perceived intelligence, while synthesis negatively affects it. Meanwhile, consumers’ perceived eeriness negatively affects their acceptance of AI-generated advertisements, while perceived intelligence positively affects their willingness to accept AI-generated advertisements. This study helps explain consumers’ attitudes toward AI-generated advertisements and offers strategies for brands and advertisers for how to use AI technology more scientifically to optimize advertisements. Advertisers should cautiously assess the possible impact of AI-generated advertisements according to their characteristics, allowing generative AI to play a more valuable role in advertising. © 2024 by the authors.'}.
